# PROJECT BRIEFING
****
***Website Concept:***
The whole project is based on minimalism, that's trying as much as possible to present the important information to the visitors of the page in the most efficient way as much as possible.

## Why that concept was chosen?
This was chosen for my project mainly due to time constraint, and to exercise on that design concept which is more loved by some of the great designers of our generation.

## Setting Up The Project
Open your code editor on your machine, most preferrably, Visual Sudio Code editor, and open your terminal. In the terminal, type the git command " git clone < https://github.com/Vatturoe/11358466_DCIT_205_IA.git > ", where the link provided is the link to the repository containing my project. After thst, you'll find all the fles on your local machine.
